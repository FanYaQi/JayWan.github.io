As we all know, x86 is today's dominant for desktop and portable computer processors while ARM(**Advanced RISC Machines**) is the dominant of microcontroller and embedded processors.

Their main difference is that they are based on different instruction set architecture:

* x86 is based on CISC(**Complex Instruction Set Computer**)
* ARM is based on RISC(**Reduced Instruction Set Computer**)

So, what's the big difference between `CISC` and `RISC`? Here are some [summaries](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/):

| CISC | RISC |
| --- | --- |
| Emphasis on hardware | Emphasis on software |
| Includes multi-clock complex instructions | Single-clock, reduced instruction only |
| Memory-to-memory : <br> "LOAD" and "STORE" incorporated in instructions | Register-to-register: <br> "LOAD" and "STORE" are independent instructions, <br>only these two instructions can access memory |
| Higher cycles per second,  <br> Smaller code sizes  | Fewer cycles per second, <br> Larger code sizes |
| Transistors used for storing complex instructions | Spends more transistors on memory registers |
| Less RAM is needed to store the assembly level instructions | More RAM is needed to store the assembly level instructions |
| Less time is needed to compile | More time is needed to compile |

The reason why we say RISC emphasizes more on software is that reduced instruction set means more burden on software design, per se, **it requires more efficient softwares and more complex compliers**.


**Today, the Intel x86 is arguable the only chip which retains CISC architecture while ARM has plenty of manufacturers. ([Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A11), [Nvidia](http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html), [Samsung Electronics](http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/), [arm](https://developer.arm.com/), etc)**.

> **With the decrease in price of RAM and the advance in compiler technology, the RISC use of RAM and emphasis on software has become ideal**.

Today, RISC is used in most real-time systems for the following 2 properties:

* ***One cycle execution time***
* ***Pipelining***: A technique that allows for simultaneous execution of parts, or stages, of instructions to more efficiently process instructions.
* ***large number of registers***: The RISC design philosophy generally incorporates a larger number of registers to prevent in large amounts of interactions with memory.

So, as for x86 and ARM, we have:

| x86 | ARM |
| --- | --- |
| Higher energy consumption | Lower energy consumption |
| Base for most desktop OS like Linux and Windows | Base for most mobile OS like Android |
