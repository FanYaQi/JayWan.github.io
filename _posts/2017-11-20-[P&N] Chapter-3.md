# What is Technology?

We have been talking about technology all the time, no matter on the annual "Apple Event" or the chatting among people. But what is technology anyway?

As mentioned in the previous chapter, the engineers focus on how to create objects that best fit the model while scientist do the other way around. "*Technology*" is defined in the dictionary of Merriam-Webster part as follows:

> 1. The practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area: engineering.
> 2. A manner of accomplishing a task especially using technical processes, methods, or knowledge new technologies for information storage.
> 3. The specialized aspects of a particular field of endeavor.

From this point of view, "*technology*" is more created by engineers than scientists. In the book *P & N*, Lee states:

> Technology is not a collection of Platonic truths that have always been lurking in the background, waiting to be discovered, but is rather a rich sociological tapestry of ideas created by human inventors.

which again assured my intuition about the term *technology*.

Such technology can be too complicated for a single person to understand thoroughly, and therefore comes the engineering way to simplify the complexity - **layering**.

> The human brain has difficulty keeping in mind simultaneously more than a few distinct components.

# Complexity Simplified

In page 51 of the book *P & N*, Lee writes:

> In fact, the point I want to make is that the human brain is incapable of comprehending any design that has 1.4 billion individual components, each with a potentially different function, despite the fact that the human brain has some 100 billion neurons, each of which does more than a transistor.

I barely disagree with this statement. The whole point of whether this statement holds lies on what does "*comprehending*" mean in this context. **Why are human beings able to produce hundreds of thousands of this kind of product everyday without even "comprehending" its design?** This question occurred to me as soon as I read this statement.

Does that indicate it's a self-contradictory statement? As far as I am concerned, it's a little bit overreacting to say so since the natural language is always ambiguous. My variant of Lee's statement is: **If we are asked to explain how does a computer work by only looking at the structure of the 1.4 billion transistors, all human beings would fail.** So we can say that we can comprehend the design or we can't, totally depending on what do we mean by "comprehend". (This is really a nerdy paragraph.)

So how do we even try to understand the 1.4-billion-component design? According to Lee, we use models of models of models of models of ... models of a transistor, which gives the designers "**freedom from choice**".(P.54) (Speaking of this, the title of this chapter is really provocative and successfully address the great idea behind it.)

> Below a platform there are many possibilities, offering more choices than any human can handle. Above the platform, there are fewer choices to be made. You can design more systems by creating a network of transistors than you can using logic gates.

The term "**freedom from choice**" again blew my mind, I have thought of the process of simplification that way, but it immediately made sense to me when I saw it. Human beings are always having trouble making decisions - even when it comes to questions such as what to eat for breakfast or lunch. A lot of people would hesitate between several options. After today, I can confidently say to those people - "You guys are actually driving the technology to develop!" And another widely used debate topic - "Is it the laziness that drives people to create new things?" occurred to me, it is to some extent, isn't it?

But while engineers are benefiting a lot from the layering of the modeling paradigms, scientists seem to be having a struggle trying to apply the same strategy to scientific research. Why? - Lee left this very interesting question to the subsequent chapter, so we'll see.

# Reductionism

As for reductionism, in my opinion, think of things in that way appropriately and critically would indeed help us to understand the problem better, but not in a extreme way to "*reduct*" problems.
