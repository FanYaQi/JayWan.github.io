| MySQL | Sqlite |
| --- | --- |
| open source | open source |
| RDBMS | RDBMS |
| Owned by Oracle. | Nobody owns it. |
| Implemented in C & C++ | Implemented in C |
| client-server base | server-less or embedded |

Furthermore, we can know from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4813890/sqlite-or-mysql-how-to-decide):

> If you need one of the following things, you need to use **mysql** or some other server-based RDBMS.:
* **Network access** - for example accessing from another machine;
* Any real degree of **concurrency** - for example, if you think you are likely to want to run several queries at once, or run a workload that has lots of selects and a few updates, and want them to go smoothly etc.
* A lot of **memory usage**, for example, to buffer parts of your 1Tb database in your 32G of memory.

To me, the major difference is that MySQL is a server based solution while `SQLite` **only runs on local files**, which means the DB engine runs as a part of your app. **So if we are writing a SOA web application, it's okay to use both**.

But if you want your database be able to be accessed by multiple users in different locations, choose `MySQL` instead.
