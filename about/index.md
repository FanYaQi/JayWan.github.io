## WHO AM I
I would like to say that I'm a romantic nerd, but maybe I am not eligible for the title "[NERD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd)". Still on my way, though.

I major in software engineering and embedded systems. I am still studying in [NJU](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/) for my bachelor's degree, during which I spent one semester in [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/) studying [EECS149](https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs149/)(Introduction to Embedded System) and [CS169](http://cs169.saas-class.org/fall-2017-info).

I'm very interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotics.
